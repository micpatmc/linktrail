## Inspiration
I came up with the idea for LinkTrail when I was curious as to how much time I am spending on various websites but didn't have a solid way to know, and with that being said I wanted to create an extension that would allow me to passively track my time across the internet and easily let me know with a single click.

## What it does
LinkTrail is an extension that allows you to track your website activity, and see where you spend your time online.

## How I built it
LinkTrail was built using **JavaScript**.
